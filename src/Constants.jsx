This could be the result of a **CORS** error or a **404**.

# MDParser
This is **MDParser**. A tool that you can use for building Markdown page by a Base64 text!
### How does this work?
Here's how it works:

* First off, you want to write your MD document in a base64, you can use the [editor](editor) or a Base64 formatter like [this](https://amp.base64encode.org/) one.
* After you write your document and converted it into a Base64 text, go to \`/?text=(md-in-base64)\` replacing the \`(md-in-base64)\` with your Base64 document.
And that's all!

(This doesn't actually support TOC at the moment.)
### What is an MDoc?
An **MDoc** is a \`JavaScript\` file loading __MarkDown__ (in **base64** or not). An MDoc can be built by creating a file like this:

\`MDoc test.mdoc\`:
\`\`\`JavaScript
window.mdoc["index"] = \`
# This is what an MDoc looks like!
This is the start text.\`; // IMPORTANT: The "index" is the property that has to be set at the end of the file!
\`\`\`
Mdocs can have **multiple pages** that can be linked like this:

\`MDoc multiple pages.mdoc\`:
\`\`\`JavaScript
window.mdoc["page"] = \`
# This is an optional page.
If you want to get back at the **index**, you can go [here](mdoc://index)!\`;

window.mdoc["index"] = \`
# Index
This page contains:
* [another page](mdoc://page)

Thank you!\`; // Index is always set at the end of the file.
\`\`\`
So as you can see, \`mdoc://(property)\` is the text that links the text to the actual __MDocs page__. The \`(property)\` must be the same as the one in \`window.mdoc[(property)]\`. Remember to set the \`index\` value at the end of the file because setting it starts the process to render it.
## Thank you.
I'll upgrade this tool so it'll be flexible and fun to use, but for now thank you for using it! ðŸ˜€`,

You can type here and your text appears in \`Markdown\` [here](on_the_right)!`,

Yes, the parsed text will appear on this box! Go back in the [editor](editor) and check it out yourself!`
